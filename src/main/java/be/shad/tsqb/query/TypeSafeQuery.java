/**
 * TypeSafeQuery aims to be a type safe alternative to build hql queries.
 * <p>
 * TypeSafeQuery uses proxies of the entities being queried to provide
 * the developer a way to create queries without coding property paths
 * in strings.
 * <p>
 * When methods on the entities are refactored, the queries will either
 * automatically be refactored too, or they will show compile errors.
 * This should help with the maintanability of the created queries.
 * <p>
 * A type safe query is created in two ways.
 * <ul>
 * <li> By using {@link TypeSafeQueryDao#createQuery()}: This will create a root query, which is always the
 *          starting point to create a query to return data
 * <li> By using {@link #subquery(Class)}: This can be used to create a subquery,
 *          which will select a value of the Class type.
 * </ul>
 * After a TypeSafeQuery instance was obtained, a proxy of the entity being queried is obtained by calling
 * the {@link #from(Class)} method with the entity class.
 * <p>
 * This proxies' getters can be used to join entities, build the where clause, order and group by.
 * <p>
 * For an example, see {@link TypeSafeRootQuery}.
